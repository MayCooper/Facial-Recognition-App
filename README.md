# Facial-Recognition-App
AI-based Face Recognition Web Application with Flask &amp; Deployment: A facial recognition deep dive into greyscale, image processing with OpenCV, Eigen images &amp; theory. Utilizing Python, classification with SVMs, Flask (Jinja Template, HTML, CSS, HTTP Methods), pipeline model, Heroku &amp; more. 

The model development process involves creating a streamlined pipeline for data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and parameter tuning. 

Once developed, the face recognition model is integrated into a Flask application and then deployed to Heroku. The entire project is structured to ensure an end-to-end understanding of developing and deploying a machine learning-based web application, starting from scratch.
